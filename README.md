## Work Experience
**Data Scientist @ Keppel Infrastructure (_May 2022 - Present_)**
- Proposed and implemented a new optimization model using deep-learning based models, reducing the energy consumption of retail cooling plant
- Designed and orchestrated the implementation of a machine learning pipeline within the Azure Databricks environment, leveraging PySpark Machine Learning APIs. These pipelines encompassed training, evaluation, model deployment, and inferencing stages, collectively streamlining the entire machine learning workflow and automating its operations.

**Data Science Intern @ Changi Airport Group (Jan 2022 - Jun 2022_)**
- Segmented the unlabeled customer dataset into churn and non-churn labels based on their recency, frequency, monetary values.
- Used XGBoost model to train the dataset based on the churn and non-churn labels and perform batch inference to predict customer churn propensity
- Attained outstanding results with a precision of 0.91, a recall of 0.92 and an F1-score of 0.91.

**Senior Engineer @ Collins Aerospace (Jul 2017 - May 2022_)**
- Used TF-IDF to compute a vector representation of the historical defects and calculate the cosine similarity between new defect phrase and historical defect phrases
- Successfully predicted the appropriate repair approach by identifying the repair method linked to historical defect phrases that are most similar to the new defect phrase
